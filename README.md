## PY_Sinope
This is my first port for two library for Home Assistant to support the Sinope devices. It contain two modules:
- pysinope.py : used for direct connect to the GT125 Sinope router
- pyneviweb.py : used to connect to the Neviweb portal from Sinope
## Required module
- crc8 : for crc calculation of binary data sent to the GT125. Not required for Neviweb connection.
